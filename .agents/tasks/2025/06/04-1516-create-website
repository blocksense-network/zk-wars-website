Implement the web-site as described in `docs/SPEC.md`.
Aim only for basic aesthetics (mostly reasonable layout).

Add `just` to the nix devShell and create a justfile with a target
for building the static version of the web-site and for launching
the dynamic version.

All build outputs should go to a `build` directory (which should be
added to gitignore).

For this first version, you can use the example benchmark data available
in `test/example-data`. The directory structure has the form:

test/example-data/${system_name}/${benchmark_name}

Read docs/TESTING.md and try to create some basic tests that will
be executed with the `just test` target.

Add suitable linters to the devShell and add a target `just lint` to
run them.

Document the structure of the example data in AGENTS.md as well as
the added just targets for testing and linting.

Try to make your tests pass without taking any inapropriate shortcuts.
