Your task is to generate some synthetic/example benchmark data according
to the schema defined in docs/SPEC.md.

The data should feature the following:

* 5 benchmarks with realistic names

* 3 different hardware configurations:
  - a single CPU system
  - a system with 2 CPUs
  - a system with a CPU and a GPU (it will have the `accelerated: true` property)

The first system should have results for all benchmarks.
The second system should have results for 4 of the benchmarks
The third system should have results for 3 of the benchmarks (including the benchmark that was not included for the second system)

All files should be placed in newly created subdirectories under `test/example-data`, following the following structure:

test/example-data/${system_name}/${benchmark_name}/results.json

Make sure that all the generated data is realistic to some extent:
  - The hardware specs roughly reflect the obtained performance
  - The consumed memory is similar for the same benchmark/action pair on the different systems. By "action", I mean "compile", "prove" and "verify", as indicated in the json schema.
