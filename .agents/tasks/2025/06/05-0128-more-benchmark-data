In git commit 2e02ddd3b66daf2bee9e44b4046825ff0749497f, I've updated the
specification of the benchmark data file format and directory structure.
Please see the commit diff for details.

Please update all existing benchmark files in the `test/example-data` dir
to match the new spec and then expand the set of data json files to include:

* 10 different benchmarks (come up with realistic names)
* 5 hardware specs (use unique realistic descriptive names)

Use similar logic as the one provided in `.agents/tasks/2025/06/04-1324-synthetic-data`
to introduce variety in the benchmark data, but also keep the results
realistic as described there.

Most benchmarks should have data for all supported toolchains (the list
is present in AGENTS.md), but make sure that there are some benchmarks,
where some of the toolchains don't support (they would lack a json file).

Adjust the javascript files to make sure they still work after the changes.
