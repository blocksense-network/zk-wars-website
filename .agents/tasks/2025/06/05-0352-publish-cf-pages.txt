Add a simple `just publish` target that will publish the static web-site
in the Cloudflare Pages platform.

Create a MAINTAINERS.md file that will provide instructions for how to set
up the user account in Cloudflare and what environment variables must be
specified when running the `just publish` command.

Make sure that direnv load ENV variables from a user-supplied .env file.
